# Project: Dotfiles

Personal dotfile configurations for editors, terminal emulators, shells, etc.

## Stack
Editor: Neovim (specifically LazyVim)
Interpreter: Zsh
Terminal Emulator: Kitty
Terminal Multiplexer: Tmux
Miscellaneous:
  - Yazi

## Architecture

Config files are symlinked into their canonical locations under `~` by
per-tool setup scripts.

## Machine-local config

`zsh/.zshrc` sources `~/.zshrc.local` last (if it exists) for per-host
config that must not live in the repo — ssh-agent/keychain, secrets,
box-specific tweaks. `.zshrc.local` is untracked and created by hand on
the machine that needs it; on machines without one the source line is a
no-op. Sourced last so it can override anything above. Only `.zshrc` is
symlinked, so `~/.zprofile` / `~/.zshenv` are also free for local use.

## Setup scripts

Each tool owns an idempotent setup script: `<tool>/setup_<tool>.sh`
(e.g. `zsh/setup_zsh.sh`, `neovim/setup_neovim.sh`). The root `setup.sh`
is a thin dispatcher that prompts y/n for each tool and delegates to the
per-tool script. Every script is runnable standalone and from any cwd.

All setup scripts share a common skeleton — match it when adding a new tool:
- `set -u`, RED/CYAN/YELLOW/NO_COLOR palette, `# ---` section dividers
- A `link_if_missing` helper for symlinks (skips existing links, refuses to
  clobber a real file at the destination)
- Self-locate via `SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"`
- Dependency installs gated on `command -v` / `dpkg -s` / `-d` checks so
  re-runs are no-ops
- End with `"<Name> dotfiles setup complete."` plus an optional CYAN hint

## Install methods: apt vs pinned binary

Default to `apt install` for setup scripts. Reach for a pinned binary
download (tracked in the root-level `versions` file) only when:
- A specific version matters (e.g. neovim, because lvim/plugins assume it).
- The apt package is missing or too stale on the target distro.
- The upstream ships only as snap (e.g. yazi) — snap isn't available on
  every environment this repo targets (notably WSL).

If none of those apply, apt keeps the setup script trivial and avoids
pinning a version we don't actually care about.

Language toolchains (conda, uv, rust, node) are a third case: install via
the upstream installer, never apt. apt lags too far behind to be usable
(e.g. it ships Rust 1.75, too old for edition2024 crates). See the
Language toolchains section.

## Neovim

Two configs coexist: `neovim/nvim/` (legacy, from-scratch) and
`neovim/lvim/` (LazyVim, actively used). Only the lvim flow is maintained
by `setup_neovim.sh`.

`nvim` and `lvim` are launched via real executable shims in `bin/`,
symlinked into `~/.local/bin/`. The shims set `NVIM_APPNAME` and exec the
pinned neovim binary. They are NOT zsh aliases — being on PATH means
they resolve from any shell context (yazi, git, cron, `$EDITOR`, sh -c).

Pinned versions for all download-managed tools (neovim, lazygit, yazi,
nvm) live in the root-level `versions` file as shell assignments
(`NVIM_VERSION=…`, `LAZYGIT_VERSION=…`, `YAZI_VERSION=…`). Setup scripts
and shims source this file directly. The shims locate the repo at launch
via `readlink -f "$0"`. Upgrade flow: bump the value in `versions`,
re-run the matching `setup_<tool>.sh`.

## Language toolchains

conda, uv, rust and node each own a setup script. PATH for all of them is
owned by `zsh/.zshrc` (`~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, the conda init
block, the nvm source block), so every installer is told NOT to edit shell
profiles — `.zshrc` is a managed symlink and must not be clobbered:
- conda: setup skips `conda init`; the hook block lives in `zsh/.zshrc`.
  Installs miniconda to `$HOME/miniconda3`.
- uv: Astral installer with `INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1`, lands in
  `~/.local/bin`. Not snap (fragile on WSL).
- rust: rustup with `-y --no-modify-path`. Removes any apt rustc/cargo
  first — they live in `/usr/bin` (earlier on PATH) and shadow the rustup
  binaries with a stale version. Cargo CLIs (grip-grab → `gg`, needed by
  lvim/pymple) go through a `cargo_install_if_wanted` helper that prompts
  y/n per crate, mirroring the root dispatcher.
- node: nvm (pinned via `NVM_VERSION`) with `PROFILE=/dev/null`; the source
  block already lives in `zsh/.zshrc`. Installs the latest LTS as default,
  which is what Copilot and other lvim plugins need.
